Our images have versions of liblzma ranging from 5.2.2 to 5.4.1. So no image has the vulnerable version 5.6.0 or 5.6.1. Also, no image has an SSH server installed.

With many modelix components being in various development stages - from stable to early and conceptual - they are released individually for each repository. To make it easier for developers we now release a dedicated modelix platform twice a year unifying everything under a single version. This platform aggregates compatible modelix component versions. We aim to provide a Spring release and an Autumn release.</description></item><item><title>Modelix Artifact Re-Grouping and Re-naming</title><link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2023/04/12/modelix-artifact-re-grouping-and-re-naming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2023/04/12/modelix-artifact-re-grouping-and-re-naming/</guid><description>In the last week we re-grouped and re-named several artifacts of modelix platform to more clearly convey their functionality. For example, the metamodel-generator is now named model-api-gen illustrating the fact that it generates a model API. Additionally, we also added correct Gradle plugin markers to ease the usage of Gradle plugins in your build scripts. We also bumped the major version of all modelix core components to indicate the breaking nature this group and name change.</description></item><item><title>Modelix Update on JetBrain's Projector</title><link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2022/09/26/modelix-update-on-jetbrains-projector/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2022/09/26/modelix-update-on-jetbrains-projector/</guid><description>On March 11 2021 JetBrains announced the initial release of Projector. It can be used to run JetBrains IDEs and Swing apps remotely over the network. Just recently JetBrains announced the suspension of Projector as its own standalone product. There are components in modelix which make use of Projector so consequently the question arises how this change affects the support in contexts such as Modelix?
This announcement by JetBrains might seem rather sudden.</description></item><item><title>Modelix Update on Log4Shell</title><link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2021/12/14/modelix-update-on-log4shell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2021/12/14/modelix-update-on-log4shell/</guid><description>A short update on the vulnerability called &amp;ldquo;Log4Shell&amp;rdquo; (CVE-2021-44228) from the modelix team:
As you most likely have heard already there is a vulnerability in the popular logging framework log4j affecting many projects, especially services logging HTTP requests. For more details on the vulnerability see the log4J announcement.
Since modelix services can face the public internet you might ask yourself if you are affected when running modelix. The good news is you are not affected by Log4Shell when you are using modelix.</description></item><item><title>Modelix Development Update 2021.1</title><link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2021/03/04/modelix-development-update-2021.1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2021/03/04/modelix-development-update-2021.1/</guid><description>This is the first post in a regular series where we will give an update on modelix development. In this first post we will look at what happened in modelix since the open source announcement by itemis last year.
MPS 2020.3 Modelix is now based on top of MPS 2020.3 and supports projects using the latest MPS version. You might wonder why 2020.2 was skipped? We encountered problems during the migration to 2020.</description></item><item><title>Modelix goes Open Source</title><link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/modelix-goes-open-source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/modelix-goes-open-source/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Modelix in the MPS Talk Series</title><link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/modelix-in-the-mps-talk-series/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/modelix-in-the-mps-talk-series/</guid><description>Modelix came public for one of the very first time last February in the first virtual MPS Talk Series organized by Jetbrains and itemis.
