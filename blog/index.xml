      <title>Blog: Modelix Update on Log4Shell</title>

        &lt;p&gt;A short update on the vulnerability called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell&#34;&gt;Log4Shell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (CVE-2021-44228) from the modelix team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you most likely have heard already there is a vulnerability in the popular logging framework log4j affecting many projects, especially services logging HTTP requests. For more details on the vulnerability see the log4J &lt;a href=&#34;https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html&#34;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since modelix services can face the public internet you might ask yourself if you are affected when running modelix. The good news is &lt;strong&gt;you are not affected&lt;/strong&gt; by Log4Shell when you are using modelix. Modelix doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the particular versions on log4J that are vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a review of our dependencies we discovered that we are in fact using log4J 1.2.17 which isn&amp;rsquo;t affected. But log4j 1.x is end of life since 2015 and doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive further updates. We mitigated this by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/modelix/modelix/pull/141&#34;&gt;replacing log4j with logback&lt;/a&gt; in the places where we used it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://logback.qos.ch&#34;&gt;Logback&lt;/a&gt; is a well maintained log4j API 1.x compatible open source project. As of now we do not think any version of modelix in its default configuration is vulnerable to the known issues of log4j 1.x. The issues are affecting the SocketServer and could result in remote code execution. The modelix default configuration does not load these classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-note-on-mps&#34;&gt;A Note on MPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelix depends on MPS for the browser based MPS editor and via projector. MPS and other IntelliJ based products from JetBrains aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/12/13/log4j-vulnerability-and-jetbrains-products-and-services/&#34;&gt;affected by Log4Shell&lt;/a&gt;. MPS and the IntelliJ Platform are using log4j 1.2.17 at the moment. Similar to modelix their default configuration does not expose the vulnerable parts of log4j.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JetBrains is &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-265069&#34;&gt;actively working&lt;/a&gt; on replacing log4j 1.x.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Modelix Development Update 2021.1</title>
      <link>https://modelix.github.io/blog/2021/03/04/modelix-development-update-2021.1/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;This is the first post in a regular series where we will give an update on modelix development. In this first post we will look at what happened in modelix since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.itemis.com/en/modelix-and-the-future-of-language-engineering&#34;&gt;open source announcement&lt;/a&gt; by itemis last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mps-20203&#34;&gt;MPS 2020.3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelix is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/modelix/modelix/pull/57&#34;&gt;now based&lt;/a&gt; on top of  MPS 2020.3 and supports projects using the latest MPS version. You might wonder why 2020.2 was skipped? We encountered problems during the migration to 2020.2 which were supposedly fixed in the code was designated to become MPS 2020.3 and we decided to skip this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;native-html-editors&#34;&gt;Native HTML Editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While modelix features a &amp;ldquo;picture based&amp;rdquo; editor for existing MPS languages from the very beginning, modelix is also working on editor implementations that are native to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of such editor implementations is the &amp;ldquo;web aspect&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;modelix.notation&amp;rdquo; language. Right now these editor definitions are focused on textual editors that render directly in the browser using HTML. The HTML for the editor is rendered on the server and then send to the client. Updates to the editor are also rendered on the server and the affected HTML is updated on the client side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;web-notation.png&#34; alt=&#34;screenshot of the web notation editor&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation is not feature complete yet but should give you a good impression what&amp;rsquo;s to come in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modelix-at-mps-talks&#34;&gt;Modelix at MPS Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the MPS talk series, an online event organized by itemis and JetBrains, Sascha presented modelix. The presentation includes a live demo of the collaborative features and a detailed explanation on how conflicting edits are handled as well as an overview on the modelix architecture. Check out the recording the &lt;a href=&#34;https://modelix.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/modelix-in-the-mps-talk-series/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-bindings&#34;&gt;Project Bindings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many smaller contributions Federico has made a large &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/modelix/modelix/pull/58&#34;&gt;contribution&lt;/a&gt; improving the interoperability between modelix and MPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project bindings allow you to configure connections to a modelix backend inside  of your MPS project and persist this configuration. While connections to a modelix repository where always possible, they were never persisted as part of the project. The configuration is now stored as a file along with the rest of the MPS project and can be committed as part of your normal version control workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project bindings are the bases for uses cases where existing models are easily migrated into modelix by an end user.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Modelix came public for one of the very first time last February in the first virtual MPS Talk Series organized by Jetbrains
and itemis. In one of the most antecipated talks Sascha Lisson gave us an overview of Modelix and its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
